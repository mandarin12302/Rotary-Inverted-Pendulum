# Rotary-Inverted-Pendulum
Rotary Inverted Pendulum 
This model is linearized around [0,0,0,0], simulink model is based on that.
0. Make sure that all the files are included in the same folder, and MatLab should include the required toolbox and Simulink.
1. Run the main.m first
2. then go to the linearmay19.mdl with is a simulink file 
3. Doulbe click the scope to check the simulation results
4. went back to main.m and change the parameters of l1 & l2
5. do step 1-4 again to get new results

P.S.:
main.m aims to calculate corresponding state equation matrix A B C D with the length of arm and pendulum as input.

Data sets are generated by the simulink. Everytime when change the length of the pendulum in the main.m, the simulink model is suppoesed to run again to get the system response data set.

Data for the paper is collected manually in o040201.xlsx
After simulink get results, I manually saved the results of system response in the excel file.

run plott.m can directly get the graph
